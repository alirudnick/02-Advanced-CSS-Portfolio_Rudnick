## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Description

```
Display samles of previous work and projects 
Display name, a recent photo and links to sections about, the work, and how to contact.
When I click one of the links in the navigation, the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
When I click on the link to the section about work, the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
When I am presented with the developer's first application, that application's image should be larger in size than the others
When I click on the images of the applications, I am taken to that deployed application
When I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices, I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to the viewport

```
## Mock-Up
